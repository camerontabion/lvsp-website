              <b>Sydney Villanueva</b> studied Information Technology at West Career
              and Technical Academy. She has always been interested in computer science, and it
              was truly heightened when she had to do a programming project in 8th grade.
              Sydney wants to expand her knowledge in computer science so she can do and create
              amazing things in the future. Currently, she is a lifeguard and loves teaching
              kids how to swim and feel comfortable in the water. Her hobbies include painting
              and piano, as a stress reliever.

              <b>William Zielinski</b> is a freshman at UNLV studying computer engineering. He was
              home-schooled until his senior year when he attended CSN for most of his classes.
              As a home-schooled student he participated in 4-H activities such as robotics,
              digital photography, cooking, rabbit showmanship, and woodworking. William has
              always been very interested in technology and has been taking coding classes
              since he was 10 years old. He is extremely excited to attend UNLV and obtain the
              knowledge necessary to succeed in a computer engineering career.

              <b>John Jimenez</b> graduated from Eldorado High School in 2020.
              Now, he is a student at UNLV studying computer engineering.
              John chose to pursue a computer engineering major because one of his high school teachers introduced
              him to computers and robots, which he really liked programming, design, and building.
              John's dream job would be to work in a great company (Tesla, Google, Microsoft, etc) or
              even starting one.

              <b>Angel Vargas</b> will be attending UNLV, where he plans to
              major in computer science. He wants to pursue a computer science degree because he realized
              how incredible and fascinating making websites, apps, or even games is, and plans expand his
              knowledge to cyber security and software engineering. Angel enjoys watching anime,
