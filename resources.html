        <p class="resource-text">
          <a href="https://www.unlv.edu/finaid/">UNLV's Financial Aid website</a> lists their phone number,
          and they suggest that this is the best way to contact them.
          Once UNLV campus is open, you can also stop by their office and request an appointment.
          Sometimes it, unfortunately, takes several attempts to get an answer. You can also request an
          appointment with
          Financial Aid by calling them. If you see that your financial aid is not getting disbursed, contact
          UNLV Financial Aid immediately.
